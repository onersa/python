# CODE SUMMARY FROM caluse.ai
# This code simulates rolling two dice together (a D6 and a D10) 1,000 times and analyzes the distribution of their combined sums.

# **What it does:**
# 1. **Creates two dice:** A standard 6-sided die and a 10-sided die
# 2. **Rolls and sums:** Rolls both dice 1,000 times, adding their results together (possible sums range from 2 to 16)
# 3. **Tracks frequency:** Counts how often each sum appears
# 4. **Calculates proportions:** Converts frequencies to proportions rounded to 2 decimal places
# 5. **Visualizes results:** Creates a bar chart showing the distribution of sums, with x-axis ticks at every integer
# 6. **Saves the chart:** Exports the visualization as an HTML file

# **Key insight:** Unlike a single die where all outcomes are equally likely,
# the sum of two dice creates a non-uniform distribution. Middle values (like 7-9) appear more frequently 
# because there are more combinations that produce them, while extreme values (2 and 16) are rare
# since they can only occur one way each.

# **Note:** The title says "Two D6" but the code actually uses a D6 and D10.
