# ===============================================================
# CODE SUMMARY FROM caluse.ai
# This code simulates rolling a six-sided die 1,000 times and visualizes the results.

# **What it does:**
# 1. **Rolls the die:** Creates a `Die` object and rolls it 1,000 times, storing each result
# 2. **Tracks frequency:** Counts how many times each number (1-6) appears using a `frequency` list
# 3. **Calculates proportions:** Converts the frequencies to proportions (percentages as decimals rounded to 2 places)
# 4. **Visualizes results:** Creates a bar chart using Plotly showing how often each die face appeared

# The visualization helps demonstrate that with enough rolls, 
# each number should appear roughly equally often (about 16.7% or 1/6 of the time), 
# illustrating the law of large numbers and fair die probability.
# ===============================================================

# Create a D6.
die = Die()
# Make some rolls, and store results in a list.
